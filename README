1. What is this library?
Nuzz is a pure OCaml implementation of the 9p protocol.
It is a fork of OCaml-9P which, as of this writing, hasn't
been updated in 7 years.

2. What is nuzzing?
The sound a camel makes is sometimes called "nuzzing".
All of the <lang>9p | <lang>-9p name permutations are confusing,
in my opinion, so I wanted something unique so people can just say
"nuzz sucks" and it's clear what trash library is being referenced.

I figured, since this is a communication protocol written in OCaml,
it wasn't a terrible name.

  1. What is OCaml-9P
  OCaml-9P is an OCaml implementation of the 9P file system protocol, and is
  intended to be used as a library.
  Currently, only the client part of the protocol is (partly) implemented.
  It can be used to implement a 9P client. The implementation is inspired
  by libixp (http://www.suckless.org/wiki/libs/libixp) and Ruby-IXP
  (http://home.gna.org/rubyixp/).
  It was primarily created to be used with Window Manager Improved
  (http://www.suckless.org/wiki/wmii).
  
  OCaml-9P used to be named OCaml-IXP. 
  
  2. Installation
  The usual installation is just a matter of:
  make && make install
